Use an ether faucet
Make sure you have enough ether in your account to do the deployment. You can acquire ether on the Ropsten network through a service known as a faucet. While there are multiple faucet sites out there, one service we recommend is hosted by MetaMask.

Navigate to MetaMask's Test Ether Faucet.

Connect to the Ropsten Test Network using MetaMask.

The faucet will link to your first account. Click "Request 1 Ether From Faucet" to submit your request.

Within a short period of time, your account will be populated with the requested ether.

We are now ready to deploy to Ropsten!
